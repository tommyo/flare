Flare is an experiment in using ChatGPT to rewrite an existing open source project in a different language. In this case [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), which is written largely in Scala, to Go.

Read the [initial conversation](ChatGPT_Getting_Started.md) for an idea of how this started.

A [follow up conversation](ChatGPT_Spark_Connect.md) was started around implementing the [Spark Connect](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html) interface in Go.
